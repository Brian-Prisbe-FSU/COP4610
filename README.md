## Project 1: Implementing a Shell 

### Group Members:
- Ellis, Ashley :  3, 5, 8 , 10
- Ma, Melissa :  1, 4, 7, 10
- McKenzie, Justin : 2, 6, 9, 10

### Problem Statement
Design and implement a basic shell interface that supports input/output redirection, pipes, background processing, and a series of built in functions as specified below. The shell should be robust (e.g. it should not crash under any circumstances beyond machine failure). Unless otherwise specified, the required features should adhere to the operational semantics of the bash shell.

### Allowed Assumptions
- Error messages do not need to match the exact wording of the bash shell, but should indicate the general cause of the error
- No more than two pipes (|) will appear in a single line
- You do not need to handle globs, regular expressions, special characters (other than the ones
specified), quotes, escaped characters, etc
- There will be no more than 10 aliases
- Pipes and I/O redirection will not occur together
- Multiple redirections of the same type will not appear
- You do not need to implement auto-complete
- You only need to expand environment variables given as whole arguments e.g. echo $USER
- The above decomposition of the project tasks is only a suggestion, you can implement the
requirements in any order
